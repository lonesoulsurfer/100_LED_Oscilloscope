Admittedly, the resolution isn't great for checking measurements (it is only 100 pixels!). However, it is fantastic at visualizing audio waveforms via a mic.


There are 4 IC's that make up the project. First there are the 4017 decade counter and a LM3914 LED driver which control the LED's. Next is a 555 timer for clock input and lastly a 386 op amp to increase the signal.

I have used the 5mm X 5mm square LED's again for the LED matrix and they work great in a project like this. If you have ever tried to solder a bunch of round LED's into a PCB then you'll know that it can be hard keeping them straight. The square ones have a flat top which makes it wash to align them correctly and keep them straight and flat.


This is a really fun little project and although it has a lot of LED's, the overall components is minimal and isn't hard to put together. Credit to Eddy Bergman who I was inspired by to build this project.
